# AtomicExchange: Decentralized NFT Marketplace with On-Chain Royalties and Privacy

AtomicExchange is a cutting-edge, decentralized NFT marketplace built with Rust, designed to facilitate efficient and private trading of non-fungible tokens. It leverages on-chain royalties to ensure creators are compensated fairly for secondary sales, and employs zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enhance transaction privacy and significantly reduce gas consumption compared to traditional NFT marketplaces.

The platform aims to address several critical challenges in the current NFT ecosystem, including high transaction fees, lack of creator royalty enforcement, and concerns about privacy. By utilizing ZKPs, AtomicExchange allows users to prove the validity of their trades without revealing sensitive information such as the NFT's specific identifier or the trade's price. This not only enhances user privacy but also dramatically reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored on-chain, resulting in lower gas fees. The on-chain royalty mechanism guarantees that creators receive their designated percentage of the sale price automatically, preventing royalty evasion commonly seen on other platforms.

AtomicExchange distinguishes itself through its focus on performance, security, and user privacy. Built with Rust, the core logic benefits from the language's memory safety and performance characteristics, ensuring a robust and efficient marketplace. The integration of ZKPs allows for private and cost-effective transactions, making NFT trading more accessible to a broader audience. Furthermore, the transparent and immutable nature of on-chain royalties fosters trust and incentivizes creators to participate in the ecosystem. This combination of features positions AtomicExchange as a leading platform for the next generation of NFT trading.

## Key Features

*   **On-Chain Royalties:** Royalties are enforced directly on the smart contract level, guaranteeing that creators receive their designated percentage of each sale. The royalty percentage is configurable at the NFT contract level.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Privacy:** Utilizes zk-SNARKs to prove the validity of transactions without revealing sensitive details, enhancing user privacy and reducing on-chain data.
*   **Optimized Gas Consumption:** By minimizing the amount of data stored on-chain through ZKPs, transaction costs are significantly reduced, making NFT trading more affordable. Specifically, we use Groth16 for proof generation and verification, which requires smaller proofs suitable for efficient on-chain verification.
*   **Decentralized Order Book:** Employs a decentralized order book to facilitate peer-to-peer trading, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Orders are matched directly between buyers and sellers based on price and other criteria.
*   **Atomic Swaps:** Enables atomic swaps of NFTs and other tokens, ensuring secure and trustless transactions. The smart contract guarantees that either both assets are exchanged or neither, preventing partial execution.
*   **Rust-Based Smart Contracts:** Written in Rust for enhanced security, performance, and maintainability. Using Rust's ownership model and memory safety features mitigates common smart contract vulnerabilities.
*   **Cross-Chain Compatibility (Future):** Designed with future cross-chain compatibility in mind, allowing for the trading of NFTs across different blockchain networks. We plan to integrate support for bridges and cross-chain messaging protocols.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The primary programming language used for smart contract development, leveraging its memory safety, performance, and strong ecosystem.
*   **Solidity:** Used for deploying the core marketplace contracts and NFT contracts to the Ethereum or compatible blockchain.
*   **SnarkyJS (or Circom):** A framework for creating zero-knowledge proofs. SnarkyJS provides a higher level abstraction for defining constraint systems used in generating zk-SNARKs.
*   **Groth16:** A widely used zk-SNARK proving system, known for its efficient proof generation and verification.
*   **Web3.js (or ethers.js):** A JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. Used for front-end integration and wallet interaction.
*   **IPFS:** Used for storing NFT metadata and assets in a decentralized and immutable manner.
*   **PostgreSQL:** For storing off-chain data related to user accounts, order book, and transaction history.

## Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** Follow the instructions on the official Rust website ([https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)) to install Rust and Cargo.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/AtomicExchange.git
    cd AtomicExchange

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    cargo build --release

4.  **Install Node.js and npm (if needed for front-end development):**
    Download and install Node.js and npm from the official website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)).

5.  **Install Front-End Dependencies (if applicable):**
    cd frontend
    npm install

## Configuration

1.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the following environment variables:

    DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database
    ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL
    PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY (for deploying contracts and signing transactions)
    IPFS_GATEWAY=YOUR_IPFS_GATEWAY_URL

2.  **Smart Contract Addresses:**
    After deploying the smart contracts, update the `config.json` file (or equivalent) with the addresses of the deployed contracts. These addresses will be used by the front-end and back-end to interact with the contracts.

## Usage

1.  **Running the Smart Contracts:**
    Compile the Solidity contracts using a Solidity compiler such as `solc`. Deploy the compiled contracts to an Ethereum test network (e.g., Ganache) or a mainnet network.

2.  **Interacting with the Smart Contracts:**
    Use Web3.js (or ethers.js) to interact with the deployed smart contracts. For example, to create a new listing:

    

3.  **Generating Zero-Knowledge Proofs:**
    Use SnarkyJS (or Circom) to define the constraint system for your ZKP circuit. Generate the proving and verification keys, and use these keys to generate and verify proofs for transactions. The exact implementation will depend on the specific transaction logic you are trying to prove.
